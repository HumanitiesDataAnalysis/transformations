# Basic Transformations for the Digital Humanities

This is a set of one-page introductions to some of the basic transformations used by digital humanists.  It's a bit skeletal at the moment, but the basic idea is to provide 1-page introductions (with, potentially, some citations on the backside) to some of the basic operations a researcher in DH might do at a high level that aims to describe *what they do* but not necessarily *how they work*, suitable for handing out in a workshop.

For more on what I mean by a transformation (and how it differs from "algorithm," the normal word here), see [Schmidt, Benjamin. “Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?” In Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016, edited by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2016.](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/99)

They were originally created by [Ben Schmidt](http://benschmidt.org) for the workshop [Images and Texts in Medical History](medicalhistworkshop.org) organized by Virginia Tech at the National Library of Medicine.

### Organization

Each transformation is a discrete markdown file in the directory `transformations`. The `Makefile` compiles these using pandoc into pdf files

Pull requests welcome, forks permitted.

### License

Licensed [CC-BY NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/).

This is fairly straightforward. The BY part means that if you compile the markdown to something other than PDF, you should include the author's name.
